## Brief description
This desktop prototype was created to conduct observational studies at the UCL Grant Museum of Zoology. It allows tracking visitors' paths, number of stops, and logging time spent in the museum, next to the objects and walking time.

## Functionality
The user can log data of several visitors (one at a time) by marking their path on the canvas. 
In the window on the right, the system displays the visitor number, the number of their stops and the start time of browsing a certain cabinet.
In case several visitors are tracked on one canvas, the paths are marked different colours that correspond to the colour of "Visitor #" in the right window. The user can also clear the canvas and retrieve data by clicking "Show all" as well as remove logged data by clicking "Remove" next to "Visitor #".
By clicking "Save data", the prototype generates the .json document with visitors' points of interest, time spent next to the objects, time spent in the museum.

## Ethics
This prototype does not collect any data that can threaten the anonymity of visitors.
